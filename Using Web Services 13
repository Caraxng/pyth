Using Web Services 
Chapter 13 
Part 1
Data On The Web :

* With HTTP request/response cycle( learned about sockets,urllib,how to pull out html off the web)well understood and well supported,there was a natural move 
towards exchanging data between programs using these protocols
* We needed to come up with an agreed way to represent data going between applications and across networks
* There are two commonly used formats : XML and JSON

Now using same request response cycle to retrieve information specifically designed for programmatic consumption

Why not produce data in a format that makes good sense to a program because programs wanna talk to each other. If you recall the whole idea of sockets is one applicat
ion process sending data to another application


SENDING DATA ACROSS THE NET

PHP                                  JavaScript
Array                                  Object

{

         'name':'Chuck'
         'phone':'303-4456'


}
Python                                 Java
Dictionary                            HashMap

a.k.a wire protocol ,what we send on the wire
 different languages and they are all connected and they might want to send data true the network php,java programs and we have to decide on a protocol 
 that is indepedent of prog language and we call that the wire protocol.
 
 Because if you were to take some connection and watch the exact characters that go back and fort,thats what you would see if you are monitoring the wire
 
 AGREEING ON A WIRE FORMAT
 
 Python 
 
 Serialize
 
 <person>
 <name>
 Chuck
 </name>
 <phone>
 303-4456
 </phone>
 </person>
 
 De-serialize   Java Hashmap
 
 xml
 
 Another format 
 
 JSON
 JavaScript Object Notation
 
 Simpler and easier but not precise as xml
 
 PHP                                  JavaScript
Array                                  Object

{

         'name':'Chuck'
         'phone':'303-4456'


}
Python                                 Java
Dictionary                            HashMap



json is very common used in apis and rest
