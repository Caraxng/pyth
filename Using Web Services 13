Using Web Services 
Chapter 13 
Part 1
Data On The Web :

* With HTTP request/response cycle( learned about sockets,urllib,how to pull out html off the web)well understood and well supported,there was a natural move 
towards exchanging data between programs using these protocols
* We needed to come up with an agreed way to represent data going between applications and across networks
* There are two commonly used formats : XML and JSON

Now using same request response cycle to retrieve information specifically designed for programmatic consumption

Why not produce data in a format that makes good sense to a program because programs wanna talk to each other. If you recall the whole idea of sockets is one applicat
ion process sending data to another application


SENDING DATA ACROSS THE NET

PHP                                  JavaScript
Array                                  Object

{

         'name':'Chuck'
         'phone':'303-4456'


}
Python                                 Java
Dictionary                            HashMap

a.k.a wire protocol ,what we send on the wire
 different languages and they are all connected and they might want to send data true the network php,java programs and we have to decide on a protocol 
 that is indepedent of prog language and we call that the wire protocol.
 
 Because if you were to take some connection and watch the exact characters that go back and fort,thats what you would see if you are monitoring the wire
 
 AGREEING ON A WIRE FORMAT
 
 Python 
 
 Serialize
 
 <person>
 <name>
 Chuck
 </name>
 <phone>
 303-4456
 </phone>
 </person>
 
 De-serialize   Java Hashmap
 
 xml
 
 Another format 
 
 JSON
 JavaScript Object Notation
 
 Simpler and easier but not precise as xml
 
 PHP                                  JavaScript
Array                                  Object

{

         'name':'Chuck'
         'phone':'303-4456'


}
Python                                 Java
Dictionary                            HashMap



json is very common used in apis and rest


XML 

Extensible Markup Language 

* Main purpose is to help information systems share structured data
* Started as simplified subset of the standard generalized markup language SGML and is designed to be relatively human-legible

XML TERMINOLOGY

Tags : Indicate the beginning and ending of elements 

Attributes : Key/Value pairs on the opening tag of xml element

Serialize/De-serialize: Convert data in one program into a into a common format that can be stored and or transmitted between systems in programming language
independent manner

XML Basics 

<Person>         #start tag
 <name> Chuck</name> # end tag
 <phone type="int'l">  #attribute  key equals value
 +178049985896   #text content
 </phone>
 <email hide="yes"/>  # self closing  tag where you don't have a closing tag. All together. All needed data is in attribute.
</person>       # end tag

Same as html difference we name the tag anything we want. 


WHITE SPACE 

Xml doesn't care much about whitespace. It does in text areas. 
Line ends do not matter.
White space is generally discarded in text elements.
We indent only to be readable


XML Elements or Nodes

Simple and complex elements





















XML TREE

<a>
 <b>x</b>
 <c>
  <d>y</d>
  <e>z</e>
 </c> 
</a> 


Elements & Text 

XML Texts And Attribute :
<a>
 <b W="5">x</b>
 <c>
  <d>y</d>
  <e>z</e>
 </c> 
</a> 


XML As Paths :

<a>
 <b>x</b>      a/b/b   X
 <c>
  <d>y</d>     a/c/d/  Y
  <e>z</e>     a/c/e   Z
 </c> 
</a> 


XML Schema

* Description of legal format of an xml
* Expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and contents of documents
* Often used to specify a contract between systems ' my systems only accepts xml that conforms to this particular schema '.
* If a particular piece of xml meets the specification of the particular schema ,it's said to validate


XML Validation

             xml document
                                              Validator
            xml schema contract 
            

XML Document :


<person>
 <name>Chuck</name>
 <phone>303-4456</phone>
</person>      
                                             Validator . XML Doc and Schema points to a validator

SCHEMA CONTRACT

<xs: complexType name="person">
 <xs:sequence>
  <xs:element name="lastname" type"xs:string"/>
  <xs:element name="age" type"xs:integer"/>
  <xs:element name="dateborn" type"xs:date/>
 </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
